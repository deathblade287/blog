NOTE: DO A SIMILAR THING FOR MOVIES/SERIES

I have tried to keep this in the order that I read them the first time but honestly I don't entirely remember. Alsom I'm sure there are many books I have missed that were on your list and many that I missed that would have been in mine had I had found them during my pre-writing dig of my "books closet".

## the wimpy kid diaries
I know, I know, a weird first choice, or any choice really but let me explain. I don't remeber when I read the firs one but it was probabbly in first or seond grade. The thing is, when you're 8, nobody's telling you "the truth" - everybody wants to shield you from the world, they tell you its all rainbows and unicorns but clearly it isn't. The wimpy kid series in the only source of content I could find that didn't shield me. Greg was a narccis, his big brotther an asshole and his smaller brother spoilt - that family was a much more accurate representation of what life looked like than some fairytale. I don't know why but at that time, this reality gave me a lot more comfort than anything else. and its not like jeff kinney is dropping truth bombs on you, she weaves in reality through a sense of humor and witt. It always made me laugh and still taught me a lot. 

## the Geronimo Stilton series
first story that I got truly invested in, it taught me imagination and that everyone, even in a world full of speaking mice want to fit in.

## mindset by carol s. dweck
This is an amazing book if you want to understand and overcome stubborness. It lays out very clearly the causes, signs and consequences of having a "fixed minset", i.e. beleiving things and especially your opinions are set in stone. The only problem with this is that if you back down on a opinion you publicly beleived in before, people are going to invalidate everything you say after that. The reality is, the more someone admits they are wrong, the less likely they are to hold a opinion that goes against their beleives because they are not only open to but are quick to adapt. 


## the subtle art of not giving a f*ck
my god i love mark manson. A lot of his advice seems counterintuiive but he really does make a good point of people giving to much of their energy (or f*cks as he calls it) to things that don't *actually* matter. The problem with this is that it's a hard process to be honest to yourself and to understand what truly matters to you - and to accept that you wasted a lot of time worrying about things that don't.

## outliers
this book bugged the hell out of me. at one point I just slammed it down and didn't pick it up for a few months. Malcolm gladwell gives anecdotal example of talented and hardworking people "making it" and the same kind of people not - the only difference, luck. whether it's your birthdate or your family wealth, there is always something a key factor to your success that's out of your control. This thought irritated me because (1) it was all anecdotal and because (2) i kinda beleived it. That devestatted me, because it meant that in when push comes to shove, i really don't have any control of my life or what becomes of me. its a scary thought. I got over this by realizing that awareness is always a power - i would not have control over certain things whether I had read the book or not but reading the book made me aware of this weakness and I hope a chance to overcome the circumstances that limit me.
