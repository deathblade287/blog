NOTE: DO A SIMILAR THING FOR MOVIES/SERIES

I have tried to keep this in the order that I read them the first time but honestly I don't entirely remember. Alsom I'm sure there are many books I have missed that were on your list and many that I missed that would have been in mine had I had found them during my pre-writing dig of my "books closet".

## the wimpy kid diaries

I know, I know, a weird first choice, or any choice really but let me explain. I don't remeber when I read the firs one but it was probabbly in first or seond grade. The thing is, when you're 8, nobody's telling you "the truth" - everybody wants to shield you from the world, they tell you its all rainbows and unicorns but clearly it isn't. The wimpy kid series in the only source of content I could find that didn't shield me. Greg was a narccis, his big brotther an asshole and his smaller brother spoilt - that family was a much more accurate representation of what life looked like than some fairytale. I don't know why but at that time, this reality gave me a lot more comfort than anything else. and its not like jeff kinney is dropping truth bombs on you, she weaves in reality through a sense of humor and witt. It always made me laugh and still taught me a lot.

## the Geronimo Stilton series

first story that I got truly invested in, it taught me imagination and that everyone, even in a world full of speaking mice want to fit in.
