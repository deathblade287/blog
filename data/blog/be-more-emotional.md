Life is too short to have a good poker face.<br>
I question not the merit but the purpose of being driven entirely by logic.<br>
What do you achieve from a ruthless ambition of external, likely materialistic things?<br>
from pursuing blank accolades?<br>
What is wrong with the world that people don’t break into dance more often?<br>
Tell me again, why exactly is it that I must be successful?<br>
Why can’t I live, laugh, love so to speak.<br>
My tears from happiness are just as sweet as<br>
my tears of sadness are painful<br>
5 seconds of thought will reveal, the horrifying realities<br>
of every present neutrality<br>
don’t be so naive as to dismiss the madness it takes to live such a sterile life<br>
Life is too short to have a good poker face.<br>
