Life is too short to have a good poker face.
I question not the merit but the purpose of being driven entirely by logic.
What do you achieve from a ruthless ambition of external, likely materialistic things?
from pursuing blank accolades?
What is wrong with the world that people don’t break into dance more often?
Tell me again, why exactly is it that I must be successful?
Why can’t I live, laugh, love so to speak.
My tears from happiness are just as sweet as
my tears of sadness are painful
5 seconds of thought will reveal, the horrifying realities
of every present neutrality
don’t be so naive as to dismiss the madness it takes to live such a sterile life
Life is too short to have a good poker face.
