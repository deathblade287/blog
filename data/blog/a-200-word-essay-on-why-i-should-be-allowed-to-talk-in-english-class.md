summary: Today in english class my teacher told me and my friends that if we write a 200 word persuassive essay on why we should be allowed to talk in class, she'll let us do so. I didn't share this with her since I don't know how sportingly she will take it. However writing this essay, I felt like I voiced out many concerns that a lot of students want to raise but don't in a relatively small-form content.

_Context: Today in english class my teacher told me and my friends that if we write a 200 word persuassive essay on why we should be allowed to talk in class, she'll let us do so. I didn't share this with her since I don't know how sportingly she will take it.

The traditional paradigm of a silent classroom, where the teacher imparts knowledge, seems increasingly futile in today's world. Research indicates that introducing elements of friendly banter into a learning environment can enhance productivity. A Harvard Business Review study reveals that such interaction stimulates creativity, nurtures trust, and fosters stronger relationships. Wouldn't our English and Literature classes benefit from this rich, engaging atmosphere?

A one-size-fits-all approach often leads to boredom, particularly when the content taught does not resonate with students. For instance, our study of Shakespeare's "Othello" has merit, but its relevance is close to none _(we are studying othello currently in IGCSE 10th grade)_. As 15-year-olds, we struggle to connect with the setting, themes, and antiquated language. The moral lessons drawn from Othello's actions may also inadvertently influence our young, impressionable minds, negatively impacting our perception of relationships and trust. From brutal murders committed based on assumptions and suicide portrayed as an almost noble choice, makes me question why we are even reading it.

In essence, a slight departure from conventional teaching methods, to embrace light-hearted conversations and relevant content, could make our learning journey more engaging and rewarding. It's an idea worth considering for the betterment of our classroom experience and also the reason why I think keeping my crew in your class is justified despite our frequent side-talking.
